Note:

* This hub hosts public templates for data science projects.  Each repository has a remote development set-up, which is in-line with team practice, i.e., we must each develop solutions via image containers.  Additionally, each template repository, except the Sphinx documentation repository, includes a deployment Dockerfile.
* The core branch of a repository must always be named **_master_**.
